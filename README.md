## About
The C++ program demonstrates some main tenants of object oriented programming, 
such as inheritance and polymorphism. There are examples on classes and objects, inheritance,
polymorphism, and pointers in the program. Explainations include memory 
allocation and deallocation. 


## Sections In main()  
    1. Regular Class Example: Dot operator VS Pointer
    2. More Stuff on Using the Dot (.) operator
    3. Inheritance, Polymorphism, and the delete keyword

## Questions  
Question people asked:

      1. Why should I have my class blueprint in a seperate .h file and a seperate file for my class implementation (.cpp)?
         It simply seperates the implementation from the interface. As a programmer, you may want to see what the program 
         does as a whole when reviewing a collegue's code. Simply looking at the functon name and comments provides the 
         overall architecture of the code. You may want to add additional features (extra function) to the program and not
	 change the program itself.It's good practice to do this because looking over thousands of lines of code is not ideal. 
	 Why did I not use that here? In the interest of time and this did not take many lines of code.

      2. What exactly does 'new' keyword do? What is the difference between the (.) operator and a pointer? When do you use it?
	     Explained in the following section:
		    In the main() function refer to Regular Class Example: Dot operator VS Pointer

	  3. What does the keyword virtual do? 
	     Explained in the following section: 
		    Inheritance and Polymorphism example
			In the main() function refer to Inheritance, Polymorphism, and the delete keyword

## Tests
To run tests, run the following command: 
`g++ main.cpp`
